# DakiHunt
Little website experiment powered by Blazor & ASP.Net Core. Its purpose for now is for me to learn basics of ASP development as well as web frontend.

### Goal

Currently I want this project to act as a service which will be watching various shops and report if some item became available via push notifications and whatnot.
